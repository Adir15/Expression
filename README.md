# Expression
Implementation and expression of inheritance between classes in java.
The program shows arithmetical expressions containing addition and subtraction operations only.
An arithmetic expression can be one of the following two options:
1. Atomic expression - a real number like 2 and 5.
2. Complex expression - an expression consisting of two operands that are arithmetic expressions, and an addition or subtraction operator between them.

The AtimicExpression class inherits from the Expression class and represents an atomic mathematical expression.
The abstract class CompoundExpression inheriting from Expression represents a compound arithmetic expression.

Both the AdditionExpression and SubtractionExpression classes that inherit from the CompoundExpression class represent an addition and subtraction 
expression respectively.

The main program contains various random phrases, and represents the various phrases (screenshot attached).
